# Eye-Blink-Detection
## Basic Overview:
This repository contains the code, instructions, and resources for building an eye blink detection application using OpenCV, MediaPipe, and CVZone. 
The application utilizes facial landmark detection and image processing techniques to identify eye blinks in real-time.

## Features:
+ **Eye blink detection**: 
  - The application accurately detects eye blinks based on changes in the distance between facial landmarks around the eyes.
+ **Real-time feedback**: 
  - The application provides visual feedback, such as a counter or animation, to indicate detected eye blinks.
+**Customizable parameters**: 
  - The application allows users to adjust parameters such as blink threshold and detection sensitivity.
+ **Open-source libraries**: 
  - The application utilizes OpenCV, MediaPipe, and CVZone, making it accessible and customizable.

## Getting Started:
+ **Install dependencies**:
  - Install OpenCV, MediaPipe, and CVZone.
+ **Download code**:
  - Download the code from this repository.
+ **Configure settings**:
  - Adjust the code to specify the blink threshold and other parameters.
+ **Run the application**:
  - Execute the code to start the eye blink detection application.

## Documentation:
+ **Code documentation**: 
  - Comments and explanations within the code to understand its functionality.
+ **Parameter configuration guide**: 
  - Instructions on adjusting the blink threshold and other detection parameters.
